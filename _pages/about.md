    Hello! I’m a software developer with 7 years of experience under my belt.
</h3>

I started this website as a way to share my knowledge of software development, and to learn from putting this knowledge into a medium that can be communicated to others. Some of my software engineering skills include front-end and back-end web development, desktop application development, software design, application deployment, and code refactoring. I’m interested in test-driven development, best coding practices, software frameworks, and open-source software. I'm most experiencied in implementing software in the Java programming language, but am also versed in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL (to a level where I can make <i>or</i> break things 😄).

I spend my free time gardening, biking, reading, hiking, doing amateur astronomy, listening to podcasts, maintaining a Victorian era home.
